# Blueprint Subsystems Plugin

The **Blueprint Subsystems Plugin** is a tool for Unreal Engine developers, providing fully Blueprintable implementations of various subsystem types. 

## Features

- **Blueprintable Subsystems**: Create and manage subsystems directly in Blueprints.
- **Ease of Integration**: No coding required to define subsystems â€“ just use Blueprints!
- **Centralized Configuration**: Manage blueprint subsystem initialization directly through the Unreal Engine project settings.

## Installation

1. **Download the Plugin**: Obtain the Blueprint Subsystems Plugin from your preferred source.
2. **Add to Your Project**: Copy the plugin into your Unreal Engine project's `Plugins` directory. If the directory does not exist, create it.
3. **Enable the Plugin**:
   - Open the Unreal Engine Editor.
   - Go to the **Plugins** section in the editor.
   - Search for and enable the **Blueprint Subsystems Plugin**.
   - Restart the editor to apply changes.

## Configuration

Blueprint-created subsystems require configuration in the project settings:

1. Open **Project Settings** in the Unreal Engine Editor.
2. Navigate to **Blueprint Subsystem Settings**.
3. Add your Blueprint subsystems to the appropriate categories:
   - **Blueprint Game Instance Subsystems**
   - **Blueprint Local Player Subsystems**
   - **Blueprint World Subsystems**

This ensures that your Blueprint subsystems are correctly instantiated and managed by the engine.

## Usage

1. **Create a Subsystem Blueprint**:
   - In the Content Browser, create a new Blueprint and select the desired subsystem type as the parent class (e.g., `UGameInstanceSubsystem`).
2. **Implement Custom Logic**:
   - Open the Blueprint and add custom logic and functionality as needed.
3. **Register the Subsystem**:
   - Add your Blueprint subsystem to the **Blueprint Subsystem Settings** in the Project Settings.

The plugin will handle the rest, ensuring your subsystems are instantiated and functional at the appropriate stages of your game's lifecycle.
